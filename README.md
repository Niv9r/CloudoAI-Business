Welcome to CLOUDO Professional, a comprehensive, AI-powered platform designed to streamline every aspect of your business operations. This application provides a full suite of tools for point-of-sale, inventory management, financial reporting, employee management, and more, all accessible through a clean and intuitive interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard & AI Insights

The dashboard provides a real-time, high-level overview of your business performance.

- **KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for Gross Revenue, Net Profit, Sales Count, and Customer Count.
- **AI Co-Pilot:** Ask natural language questions about your business (e.g., "Who is my top performing employee?" or "Which products are selling the fastest?") and get instant, data-driven answers.
- **AI Anomaly Detection:** A proactive AI system that scans your sales and product data for unusual patterns (e.g., a sudden drop in sales for a popular item) and alerts you to potential issues.
- **Needs Attention Panel:** A clear, actionable to-do list highlighting critical items like low stock products and overdue expenses.
- **Visual Reports:** Interactive charts displaying sales over time and a breakdown of your top-selling products.
- **Recent Activity:** Quick views of your most recent sales and AI-powered reorder suggestions.

### 2. Point of Sale (POS)

A modern, robust POS system designed for speed and flexibility.

- **Product Grid:** A touch-friendly grid of all your products, with clear indicators for stock status.
- **Dynamic Cart:** Easily add products, adjust quantities, and manage the sale.
- **Customer Management:** Attach sales to existing customers or create new ones on the fly.

- **Discount & Coupon Support:** Apply percentage-based or fixed-amount discount codes.
- **Shift Management:** A secure "Clock-in/Clock-out" system for employees.
- **Blind Cash Reconciliation:** Enhances security by requiring employees to count their cash drawer at the end of a shift *without* seeing the expected total, flagging discrepancies for manager review.
- **Hold & Retrieve Sales:** Park a sale to be completed later, freeing up the POS for the next customer.

### 3. Sales & Customer Management

A complete suite of tools for managing your revenue streams and customer relationships.

- **Sales Log:** A searchable and filterable history of all sales and refunds.

### 4. Inventory & Purchasing

Maintain perfect control over your stock with our integrated inventory system.

- **Product Catalog:** Manage your complete product list, including SKU, category, price, cost, and stock levels.
- **Purchase Orders (POs):** A full PO workflow to order stock from suppliers. Create drafts, issue official POs, and receive items to automatically update inventory levels.
- **Stock Adjustments:** Manually adjust stock for any reason (e.g., damage, stock count correction) with a full audit history.
- **Vendor Management:** Keep a directory of all your suppliers and their contact information.

### 5. Professional Finance & Accounting

A powerful set of tools for a complete and accurate financial picture.

- **Expense Tracking:** Log all business expenses, categorize them, and track their payment status.
- **AI-Powered OCR for Expenses:** Optionally upload a receipt when creating an expense. The AI will scan the document to verify the total, vendor, and date, flagging any discrepancies for admin review.
- **AI Financial Analyst:** A dedicated chat interface allowing you to ask complex financial questions in plain English (e.g., "What was my biggest expense category in May?" or "Why did my net profit margin decrease?").
- **Comprehensive Reports:**
  - **Financial Statements:** Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements.
  - **Detailed Breakdowns:** Analyze sales by employee, top products, payment methods, and expense categories.
  - **Inventory Reports:** Get a full inventory valuation and a status overview.
  - **Custom Report Builder:** Build your own reports by selecting desired metrics (e.g., Net Sales) and dimensions (e.g., by Product, by Employee, by Day).

### 6. Employee & HR Management

Manage your team with robust tools for roles, permissions, and payroll.

- **Employees & Roles:** Create custom roles with granular permissions to control exactly what each employee can see and do.
- **Secure PIN Access:** Each employee has a unique 4-digit PIN for logging into the POS.
